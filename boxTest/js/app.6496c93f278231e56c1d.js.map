<p>A：用户每日销毁获得的奖金=每日销毁道具数量 × 每日最终价（当奖金小于0.01元时，不会获得奖金）</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t          <h4>Q：什么是每日最终价？</h4>\r\n\t\t          <p>A：集分竞宝平台每天对每种销毁道具放出一定金额，该金额为此类道具当日的销毁总价，该道具的每日最终价=销毁总价/当日销毁持有量</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t          <h4>Q：我选择了销毁道具，为什么没有给我奖金？</h4>\r\n\t\t          <p>A：每种道具销毁有一定时间周期，时间倒计时结束后，系统会统计每位用户所得奖金，并进行发放。</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t          <h4>Q：在哪儿查看我的奖金？</h4>\r\n\t\t          <p>A：成功完成“道具销毁”后，您的奖金会直接发放至“我的钱包”。您可以通过“道具销毁”页面点击“我的钱包”进行查看，也可在集分竞宝APP首页点击头像选择“我的钱包”。</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t          <h4>Q：获得的奖金能干什么？</h4>\r\n\t\t          <p>A：当您钱包中的奖金累积达到最低提现额度时，您可以将奖金提现到您的支付宝账户中，并自由支配奖金的使用。（关于提现具体操作请查看“我的钱包”内【提现帮助】）</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n      \t\t<div class=\"clonse\" @click=\"cloneBox\"></div>\r\n     </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n

<p>A：当“我的钱包”内金额达到{{userInfo.withdrawl.min_money}}元以上（含{{userInfo.withdrawl.min_money}}元），您就可以提现到支付宝账户，提现金额须为整数，单次提现金额小于{{userInfo.withdrawl.charge_amount}}元，将会产生{{userInfo.withdrawl.service_charge}}元手续费。为了保障您的账户安全，您在首次提现时需要绑定支付宝账户。</p>\r\n\r\n          <h4>Q：怎么绑定支付宝？</h4>\r\n          <p>A：您在首次提现时，会自动弹出支付宝绑定，需要您提供个人支付宝账户即可绑定，绑定后每次提现将默认提现至此支付宝账户。每个支付宝账户只可绑定一个集分竞宝账户，且每个集分竞宝账户只能绑定一个支付宝账户。</p>\r\n\r\n          <h4>Q：我完成提现了，为什么支付宝账户没收到钱？</h4>\r\n          <p>A：您的提现申请发起后，您的奖金将在1-5个工作日内到账，双休日、法定节假日顺延处理。</p>\r\n\r\n          <h4>Q：在哪里查看提现进度和到账情况？</h4>\r\n          <p>A：在集分竞宝APP内点击“头像”进入【我的钱包】，在【我的钱包】中点击【提现记录】即可查看提现历史和提现进度。</p>\r\n\r\n          <h4>Q：我提现遇到了问题怎么办？</h4>\r\n
